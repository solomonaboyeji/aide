# tiny-aide

This is a TinyAide implementation to extend ChatGPT for some of my personal tasks.

## Problems

- Some issues with text disappearing after answer has been given. Redux could be used to solve this.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## TODO

- Use Redux
- Deletion of existing chats
- Other cool features.
